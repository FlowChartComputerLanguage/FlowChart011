<a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FlowChart Computer Language is an attempt to be able to program in any 
computer language via the use of visual FlowCharting.&nbsp; Actually it's more 
accurate to call it a software schematic.&nbsp; A FlowChart is usuallty thought 
of as the logical flow of a program.&nbsp; A Data Flow Diagram is a program 
method where each&nbsp; 'symbol' works when all of the required data arrives to 
it.&nbsp; A software schematic has both logic and data flow.&nbsp; This 
FlowChart program works as a software schematic, a Data Flow Diagram, and as a 
traditional FlowChart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FlowChart is made to be used by anyone, in any language. It is designed to be 
used with graphics so that it is not dependent on text based programming.&nbsp; 
This means that it can be used by anyone whether or not they know the letters 
used by most European languages.&nbsp; FlowChart is intended to be used without 
language.&nbsp; As people use this program and come up with ideas to refine it, 
it will become more language independent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FlowChart can be used for a number reasons. It allows the source code of a 
program to be documented in a form that is easy for anyone to understand.&nbsp; 
It is made to adapt to any new computer language that has logic and data flow.&nbsp; 
It is not intended for a specific spoken, written, or programming language. 
People who speak English should be able to use the process as easily as someone 
who speaks or writes in another language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FlowChart is a picture oriented representation of what the source code of a 
computer program is doing. It is&nbsp;therefore easier to understand providing that 
the symbol designs makes sense to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an assumption that certain 
symbols have common universal meaning.&nbsp; The stop sign, a circle with an X 
through it, a stick figure of a man, or a woman, these all have universal 
meaning.&nbsp; So instead of words, there are picture symbols that represent the 
operations of the steps that a computer program is doing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The text of each symbol of FlowChart can be changed to how it uses the logic 
and data flow.&nbsp; Changing the text of a symbol will change it.&nbsp; So 
symbols can be changed into another programming language, or the dialect of the 
compiler.&nbsp; This enables anyone who understands a FlowChart to be able to 
understand what the program is doing, even if they do not know the computer 
language that it is using.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FlowChart program translates from or to almost any programming language.&nbsp; 
Of course, like anything new and complex, these first versions will have lots of 
bugs.&nbsp; With the hundreds of dialects of just the BASIC computer language, 
it would be impossible for me to code and test for every one.&nbsp; So I am 
relying on others to help test other languages, finding bugs, and add new ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The symbols that make up a flow chart can be customized to any computer 
language.&nbsp; Conversion between computer languages can be made on a line to 
line conversion. This should make it easier to translate any computer language 
into another computer language by changing each of the symbol's text that 
creates the computer program source code.&nbsp; This requires that the 
programming language has a flow of logic, uses variable names, and has a keyword 
syntax. It will not take into consideration the inherent advantages or pitfalls 
of each computer language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the goals of FlowChart is to have a universal symbol language that can 
be compiled into any computer language.&nbsp; Another goal is to be able to have 
programmers who can create code in any computer language without having to know 
the syntax and detail requirements of a specific computer language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The FlowChart has two basic units.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="FlowChart Screen 1">FlowChart Screen:</a></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FlowChart screen shows what a program does. It shows the flow of logic 
and data from one symbol to another.&nbsp; This represents what a computer 
program is doing, how the data is moved around, tested, and performs 
computations. The symbols can be as simple as a single machine instruction, or 
as complicated as a batch file that runs multiple programs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FlowChart is made up of three basic items:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Paths showing colored and styled lines that connect the symbol points 
	together. They show the flow of logic, and data.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Symbols show each step of a program.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Constants will connect paths with data.</p>

<p>All programs must have a symbol named, 'Start' which shows where the program 
begins.&nbsp; Even subroutines and functions must have a start.&nbsp; Device 
drivers will have multiple entry points coming out of the start.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A FlowChart is expanded by placing more symbols on the FlowChart screen. Each 
symbol added will define an instruction of what the program is does. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diagram will be completed by adding symbols and paths between the dots of 
symbols.&nbsp; Make sure that the points have matching colors.&nbsp; The color 
and size of the dots on symbols show the datatype being used by each symbol.</p>

</ul>
<p>This lowest level symbol has the graphic picture for the symbol that is seen 
on the screen and in the printouts.&nbsp; A symbol has syntax to create source 
code.&nbsp; This syntax is nothing more than programmer code where the point 
names are replaced with the path names, so that one symbol can be used over and 
over again to create source code that is&nbsp; unique for each symbol placed.&nbsp; 
When macro code is entered, the syntax is automatically made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each symbol is one or two functions.</p>

	</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these functions have a symbol text that defines how the graphics are 
converted into text.&nbsp; A FlowChart for a subroutine or function will have 
two parts: </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>One is a FlowChart that defines the routine being called, such as,&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Function SubRoutine(X as integer, Y as real) as long</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Two is a symbol that you place on flowcharts to call that routine, such 
	as :</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Call SubRoutine(x, y)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong>&nbsp; Think of each symbol as doing something, whether 
it is just adding two numbers together or sorting a megabyte data file.&nbsp; 
Think of the paths that go between the symbols as the data is flowing between 
symbols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some symbols will use data as input on the paths, others will set data as 
output on the paths, and others will do both by modifying the input at the 
start, and then putting it as output at the end. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each symbol point will show as input, output, both or other options in the 
symbol&nbsp; graphics as arrows showing the direction(s) of the logic or data 
flow.</p>

<p>The option screen is where FlowChart starts at.&nbsp; The first think that 
must be done is to select the language class and dialect of the computer 
language.&nbsp; No other buttons will be available until you do.&nbsp; When it 
is selected it will load the symbols found in the file in the directory 
Languages/class/dialect Definition.Symbol.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option numbers 1-13, and 17-18, and 20-21 control what is displayed. </p>
<p>Option 14 controls if all paths must be orthogonal (up/down right/left only) 
So that when you place a path only the longest leg will be placed if this has a 
check mark. </p>
<p>Option 15 controls if FlowChart is allowed to move symbols to make room to 
auto route paths. and to keep symbols from on top of each other. </p>
<p>Option 18 this is used to stop using the clipboard to pass source code back 
and forth between programs. If it is not disabled then another computer program 
must watch the clipboard and make changes as needed. See Preprocessor / 
Postprocessor chapter. </p>
<p>Option 19 controls if the auto route is allowed to work (right now, they only 
way to turn auto on is with a /route in the tool strip text box) </p>
<p>the remaining options should all be turned off. (but I left them in, incase 
you needed to find a problem. cause the program still has lots of unsolved 
problems.)</p>

<p>FlowChart is used to visually show a computer program's execution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Converting an existing computer program to the FlowChart Computer Language is 
one method of using FlowChart.&nbsp; Another method is to use&nbsp; FlowChart to 
create a program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subroutines and functions will be labeled inside the start symbol.&nbsp; It 
will be in the micro text and also in the syntax of the start symbol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A start symbol could be any of the following.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>the beginning of a program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>the entry point of a function, or subroutine.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>the entry points of a device driver or other system routine.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>the start of a batch file, and other computer directives.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A function is something left over from the old programming school where a 
single value is returned by a subroutine, other than that, it is exactly like a 
subroutine. Most modern languages can and do return multiply values either by 
passing an address (sometimes called 'by reference') to the variable to be 
changed, or changing globally defined variables.</p>

<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Symbol Graphics is what users see when they are writing, checking, or 
revising symbol details. It is the only thing that programmers 
need to use to write programs, just like they only need to use the programming 
language for most of their text based written programs.&nbsp; A compiler is 
currently still required to compile the source code created by FlowChart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The graphics is made up of only two items:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>simple lines that show on the screen to tell what the symbol is. It can 
	be anything from a simple box to show a general process, a diamond to show 
	IF conditions, a disk to show where files are used, and so on. The lines can 
	have colors to help show what this function does.&nbsp; The same symbol can 
	be used with different colored lines for slight variations in the symbol 
	usage.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>points of where paths can be connected to this symbol. The points show, 
directions arrows , input, output or both. It will also have a data type that is 
defined by a color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A point can also have the option of displaying:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>symbol macro text</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>micro text as an example of the text for a symbol.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>syntax text where the variable name replaces the name of the point.&nbsp; 
	For example, the simple computer language code could look like: A = A + B</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>This would be in the symbol syntax text as:</p>
<p>{[(PointA.pathname))]}} = {[(PointA.pathname)]} + {[(PointB.pathname)]}</p>
<p>Where the name of the path connected to PointA is 'A' and the name of the 
path connected to PointB is 'B'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The names of the paths connect the symbols together. This is the path on 
which the data and logic move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the syntax is 
encoded, the graphics symbol is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used by the 
programmer in a FlowChart.&nbsp; The syntax text for the variables will be 
replaced with the name of the path that connects to the point of the symbol that 
is used.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The original file name of the symbol is kept.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>An Opcode is for symbols that will (eventually) create the object files 
	and programs.</p>

<p class="auto-style7">The rotations with flip or flop gives a mirror image of the symbol. Flip 
gives a flip mirror image sideways, then a flop mirror image up and down, so 
flipflop will first give a mirror image sideways and a flop will give a mirror

<p class="auto-style11">NAME is the name that is given to the symbol. This also

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/Language="Computer Language Class", "Dielect"</p>
<p class="auto-style11">This is for which computer language that this symbol works on. You can allow 
the symbol to have output in many different languages (one at a time).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p class="auto-style11">/Language=BASIC, FreeBasic</p>
<p class="auto-style11">/Language=basic, Visual Basic</p>
<p class="auto-style11">/Language=C, Visual C</p>
<p class="auto-style11">/Language=C++</p>
<p class="auto-style11">/Language=FORTRAN, Fortran 66</p>
<p class="auto-style11">/Language=COBOL, IBM Micro COBOL</p>

<p class="auto-style11">/Language=Lisp</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/MacroCodeText= Order, TEXT</p>
<p class="auto-style11">This is the computer code that is generated for this symbol for the above 
computer language. The reason that FlowChart works is how the Code is written 
here. The code is just generalized code with the point names replaced with the 
name of the path.&nbsp; And the properity replaces with what ever data that 
point has.&nbsp; {[(PointName.properity)]} is replace and results is PathName, 
where the point name is PointName and the properity is .Pathname.</p>
<p class="auto-style11">Order used in some languages to separate one section from another 
(Sort Order)</p>
<p>for example:</p>
<p class="auto-style11">/Program=main, {{[((SUM{{[((={{[((NUM1{{[((+{{[((NUM2{{[((;</p>
<p class="auto-style11">/Point=50,0,-1,integer,"SUM"</p>
<p class="auto-style11">/Point=-200,0,1,integer,"NUM1"</p>
<p class="auto-style11">/Point=200,100,1,integer,"num2"</p>
<p>When this FlowChart is assembled the result replaces what ever the user has 
named the paths from one symbol to another with this name (If the user has not 
named the paths, then the computer assigns a name to each to each set of 
line/paths that are connected together.) So the results would look something 
like this in the generated code file.</p>
<p class="auto-style11">My Totals=Dept One+Shoes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/Point=X, Y, input/output,Data Type, "Variable-name"</p>
<p class="auto-style11">code, x1, y1, input/output, Data Type, "name of this Point"</p>
<p class="auto-style11">code = /point</p>
<p class="auto-style11">x1,y1 is the offset from the center of the symbol (1 to 
500 with the center at 250, 250)</p>
<p class="auto-style11">input, output, both and other options are in the 
input/output drop down.&nbsp; This is to tell if the symbol is getting input to 
wirk with, or input from logic from another symbol.&nbsp; The output logic goes 
to another symbol.&nbsp; and the output of data can go to more than one symbol.&nbsp; 
Altho FlowChart structure can handle multi processor's working on the same 
program (same memory area) compilers and computers, in general, do not at this 
time. (There are exceptions, but not many)</p>
<p class="auto-style11">The data type support table is then used to get the 
color, size, style, etc.</p>
<p class="auto-style11">The name of this point is what is looked for to replace 
with the name of the path connected to it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/Line=x1, y1, x2, y2, "Color Name"</p>

<p class="auto-style11">Code = /line=</p>
<p class="auto-style11">x1, y1 is the start of the line, and x2, y2 is the end</p>
<p class="auto-style11">The name of a color is looked up in the color support 
table. </p>
<p class="auto-style11">This just draws a line in side the symbol from x1,y1 to x2,y2 of what the 
symbol displays, it has not other function. You have lines inside a symbol to

one displayed symbol to another. </p>

<p>Displaying complete symbols on the screen/page.&nbsp; </p>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
FlowChart symbol properities are the X,Y location, Rotation,</p>
<p>Paths going between points on the symbols.&nbsp; </p>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Path properities are an (X,Y) to (X,Y), a path name, a logic/data type.</p>
<p>Optionally 'constant' which are what the path value starts with. Optionally 
but ignored are errors of the program, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>&nbsp; points on a symbol not being connected.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>&nbsp; logic paths that go to two symbol inputs, assume for now single 
	liner processers, but the language is not restricted by this</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>&nbsp; paths with no source, output from at least one symbol.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>&nbsp; two paths connect with different names.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Constant properities are (X&lt;Y), The starting value (data type and name comes 
from the path it is connected to.</p>
<p>optionally 'error' messages.&nbsp; When the program needs to display an error 
at a location where the error occures. Or to point the user to where something 
needs to be changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<p><strong>Symbol&nbsp; </strong></p>
	<p>The symbol has a number of parts.&nbsp; It is defined inside a retangle 
	of from -250 to 250 in the X and Y.&nbsp; This is an artificial limit and 
	might go away, if there are to many people that need/want it larger.)</p>
	<p>Symbol properities:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Name:&nbsp; Each symbol is refered to by name.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use 
	almost any name that could be used as a variable.&nbsp; It begins and ends 
	with 'white space', white can be things like a space, tab, return, and so 
	on.&nbsp; The&nbsp; name of the symbol.&nbsp; This is so that the flowchart 
	displays this symbol by name,</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Points: Each symbol has to have the points defined.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Point properities:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	(X,Y)</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Name of the point (This is used to create the text for each symbol. (See 
	Macro Text)</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The Logic/Data Type of this point.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Lines:&nbsp; Each Symbol must have some graphics that show what this symbol 
	is.&nbsp; Usually, a flattened oval is used for the start, and also an end.&nbsp; 
	An end is somtimes just a circle. diamonds&nbsp; are usually used for 
	testing to determin directions of logic branches.&nbsp; That would include 
	things like IF, CASE, Computer Goto, WHILE, and so on.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Optionally Icons/Pictures.&nbsp; There should be Icons and pictures 
	available also.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Support Tables</strong></p>
	<li>
	<p>Color Table: The color table is used to be able to move from one system 
	to another.&nbsp; Currently its format is based on Windows 10 Color Names.&nbsp; 
	But it also has the Red/Green/Blue for other systems to create thier own 
	Color names.&nbsp; (See The details in import/export section)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>DataType Table:&nbsp;&nbsp; The data type table has information about

<p>They 'should' have color and/or distinction to tell the difference data types 
they represent.</p>
<p>Second is the symbols, which has a number of items.</p>
<p>The symbol must have a unique name.</p>
<p>A symbol must have the 'program macro code', which is just the computer 
language code with variables replaced with {{[((names of the point{{[((.</p>

<p>A symbol should have a graphics part represented by points. They should have 
lines or graphics to show what this symbol does (ie: decision branch (go to, go 
subroutine), process (subroutine, function calls), loops (do while, for next, do 
until) and so on). </p>
<p>The points has a number of significant items.</p>
<p>Points must have associated with them the logic or data types (i.e.: Integer, 
String, Floating Point) Depending on the language.</p>
<p>Points 'should' have a representation of the symbol using (input) or

<p STYLE="page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">FlowChart : Is a 
graphical representation of the logic and data paths of a program connecting symbols together 
to show the logic steps of a computer process.</p>
<p STYLE="page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">FlowChart graphics 
table : This refers to 'records' that hold the information about each located 
symbol, path segments, and constants.</p>
<p>Symbol : Is a graphical representation of a basic unit inside a FlowChart 
made up of lines and points. It contains lines, points, and other information to 
make the FlowChart into a program.</p>
<p>located symbol : This is a /use record in the FlowChart graphics table</p>
<p>Line : Is a graphical line in a symbol. It has color, but no width.</p>
<p>path segment : </p>
<p>Path : Is a graphical line in a FlowChart that represents the logic, or data 
going from one symbol to another. It has a color and width representing the type 
of data that that is moving in the program.</p>
<p>Point : Also called a connection point is in a symbol that is where the Paths 
from different symbols connect. It show where a path goes into, and comes out of 
a symbol. It has color and width for this type of data for this connection.</p>
<p>Connection Point: Is another name for Point.</p>
<p>Color : This is a name that Windows has a set of colors for. (Currently new 
color pens are not allowed, only the existing 139 color names.)</p>
<p>Data Type : This refers to the type of data that they symbol point is looking 
for. Some computer languages get very picky about this (Like C++), other 
computer languages could not care less (like BASIC).</p>
<p>DeCompiled : Thiss term refers to the process of converting a source code 
text file into the graphical FlowChart Computer Language.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Quick Start</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For starting quickly, first start the FlowChart ComputerLanguage Program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be done in a number of ways. In&nbsp; Microsoft Windows, press the 
right mouse button over the windows start icon. This will let you see all 
programs that are installed. . Then select FlowCHart.&nbsp; You can press the 
Windows key.&nbsp; If you need more help on how to install or start a computer 
program refer to your owners manual, or the Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the FlowChart program is started, there will be a splash screen 
displayed over the flowchart screen. They will both disappear and the option 
screen will display, with only one button enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The button will allow you to select the computer language.&nbsp; The list 
will have generic computer languages, and some specific ones for special useage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have to load the Symbols, Which means keywords, syntax(s), and so on, 
thendo the folloing steps</p>
<p>1, Select the FlowChart button (Far Left button )</p>
<p>2. Then on the Flowchart Screen, Select the third button (A file folder)</p>
<p>3. Then on the File InputOutput screen select the folder with an arrow 
pointing up (To open a file)</p>
<p>4. Find and select the symbol file that you require.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. You might need to repeat opening symbols. 
depending on your language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. You will need a Keyword symbol file,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c, An operator ymbol file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. a function keyword file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. One or more files for the symbols sintax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. OR itmight all becontained in a single file of 
the computer language name,and the extension of *.Symbol.</p>
<p>5. When you save a FlowChart all of the symbol files will besaved into the 
flowchart file.&nbsp; The symbol files are the basis on which FlowChart uses to 
'translate' to and from a computer language.&nbsp; Different symbol files are 
required for different languages, and dialects of languages,</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Next go back to the Symbol Screen.&nbsp; (Second buttonfrom the 
left)</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The Symbol screen has two rows of buttons.&nbsp; The top row is to 
edit symbols.&nbsp; The second row is the defaults that are applied to editing.&nbsp; 
Each button needs to have a default selected.&nbsp; The buttons shows what the 
current default is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Last enter a name of the next point to add.&nbsp; Thetext box to 
enter that is at the right of the buttons. (This will not be used until you add 
a point to a symbol, but needs to be there anyway (for now)</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Goto the FlowChart screen again(first button on the left)</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Select the select a symbol button.&nbsp; A drop down will appear 
with the defined symbols for this language.</p>
<p>11. You can now place that symbol on the FlowChart.</p>
<p>12 To place paths (lines connecting the logic and data, The button with a 
line and circles at the ends is the 'make a path connection. </p>
<p>13.&nbsp; Where ever two paths end at the same location, both must have the 
same path name (The path name is actually the name of the variable in the source 
code.)</p>
<p>14. Continue placing symbols and connectingthem with paths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional Notes:</p>
<p>1. A symbol can be made by typeing in a line of source code.&nbsp; The 
program will look for a symbol that matches the syntax and place that one the 
Flowchart with Paths connecting them.&nbsp; If no syntaxmatches, it will create 
a symbol, and then placethat one one the Flowchart.</p>
<p>2. A FlowChart can be started from the File Input/Output screen with the text 
to FlowChart button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. writting on the left of the button and symbols on 
the right makes source into flowchart</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. writing on the right of the button and the 
symbols on the left makes the source code form the FlowChart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If the auto router is turned on, it will make paths to connect any two 
paths with the same name.&nbsp; (A background task, so it might take a while to 
'catch up' to where new paths and data is entered.</p>
<p>3. </p>
